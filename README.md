# MD3Browser
.MD3 models converter to and from text form, with the extension .ED3, miming the .IQE text mode of the .IQM models.
I used a syntax of commands based on the .IQE text, in turn based on the .OBJ models.
This app doesn't enforce vertex and triangle limits, you can have models as big as you want, for example I tested it on some Windows examples of 3D models with over 100000 polygons.
